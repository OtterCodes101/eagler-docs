# Introduction

## What is Eaglercraft?

### The basics

Eaglercraft is Minecraft ported to your browser, developed by lax1dude (and ayunami2000).  
It is now maintained by the community.

There are 3 versions of Eaglercraft: 1.3, 1.5.2 and 1.8.8.  
Below you can see the differences between them:

|    Features    | 1.3 | 1.5.2 | 1.8.8 |
|:---------------|:---:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Singleplayer   |  ✅  |   ✅   |   ❌   |
| Multiplayer    |  🟠  |   ✅   |   ✅   |
| Performance    |  ✅  |   🟠   |   ✅   |
| Full port      |  🟠  |   ✅   |   ❌   |
| Usage          |  ❌  |   🟠   |   ✅   |
| In development |  ❌  |   🟠   |   ✅   |
| Shaders        |  ❌  |   ❌   |   ✅   |

:::caution Use 1.8.8!

It is recommended to use 1.8.8 over both 1.3 and 1.5.2 as it introduces more optimizations and is more actively used and developed.  
However 1.5.2 is also quite common, because it has singleplayer and some of the popular servers are still online.
